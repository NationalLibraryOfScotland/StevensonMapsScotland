The Stevenson Maps and Plans of Scotland, 1660 - 1940 - map viewer
===================================================================

<p>The <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/projects/stevenson/index.html">map viewer</a> uses <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers 4.6.5</a> for the map interface, <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> to provide filtering and a date range selector, and a <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaic of historical maps of Great Britain from ca. 1900.</p>

<p>It was created by Chris Fleet and Rachel Dishington during a 3-month placement in the National Library of Scotland from May – August 2019. The placement took place during Rachel's PhD project at the University of Edinburgh on ‘Engineering ‘Modern’ Scotland: The Stevenson Maps and Plans and Scotland’s Built Infrastructure, c.1800–c.1900’. The PhD was funded by the <a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> through the Scottish Cultural Heritage Consortium. It is a <a href="https://www.ahrc-cdp.org/">Collaborative Doctoral Partnership</a> between the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a> and the <a href="https://www.nls.uk/">National Library of Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>There were three main aims in creating the map interface:</p>

<ol>
<li> To allow the Stevenson maps covering a particular place to be quickly discovered by clicking on the place. </li>
<li> To allow easy filtering of the maps by subject and date. </li>
<li> To allow the different geographic extents of the maps to be clearly visible. </li> 
</ol>
