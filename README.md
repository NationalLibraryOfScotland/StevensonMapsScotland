The Stevenson Maps and Plans of Scotland, 1660 - 1940 - map viewer
===================================================================

The <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/projects/stevenson/index.html">map viewer</a> uses <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers 4.6.25</a> for the map interface, <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> to provide filtering and a date range selector, and a <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaic of historical maps of Great Britain from ca. 1900. 

<p>There were three main aims in creating the map interface:</p>

<ol>
<li> To allow the Stevenson maps covering a particular place to be quickly discovered by clicking on the place. </li>
<li> To allow easy filtering of the maps by subject and date. </li>
<li> To allow the different geographic extents of the maps to be clearly visible. </li> 
</ol>
